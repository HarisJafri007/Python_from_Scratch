    "Python is a Dynamic Language. If you know about C or C++ then you must have known that these programming langauges require coder to declare a variable along with its type before using it. For Example if you declare a varible as integer type variable then through out the life cycle of that C program, coder can only store integer value inside that variable. But that is not the case with Python, in python a coder do not need to declare variable before using it. Also the literal stored inside a variable can be changed, even if it means changing the literal type."
